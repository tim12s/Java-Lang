/**
 * Abstracts serialization implementation, which at least should be able to serialize objects that
 * Java built-in serialization is able serialize. In other words, {@code ObjectSerializer} abstracts
 * Java serialization re-implementations and extensions. {@link Bytes} is used as core IO interface
 * instead of {@link InputStream} + {@link OutputStream} pair, which Java built-in serialization
 * use. However, note that {@code Bytes} could always be converted to these old interfaces by
 * {@link Bytes#inputStream()} and {@link Bytes#outputStream()}, if needed.
 *
 * <p>The default fallback implementation is Java built-in serialization itself:
 * {@link JDKObjectSerializer}.
 *
 * <p>Another provided implementation is {@link BytesMarshallableSerializer}, which basically
 * extends built-in serialization with some improvements. For example, it could benefit if objects
 * implement {@link BytesMarshallable} interface the same way as built-in serialization benefit
 * if objects implement {@link Externalizable}. See {@link BytesMarshallableSerializer} docs for
 * more information.
 *
 * <p>This interface is supposed to be implemented to plug such third-party serialization
 * re-implementations, as Kryo, fast-serialization, etc.
